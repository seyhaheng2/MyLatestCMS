              %h4 Visitor Notice
              %p We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (Personal Information) or allows us to contact you.

We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:
              %ul
                %li To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
                %li To help you quickly find services or information on neowin.net.
                %li To help us create content most relevant to you.

              %h4 Visitor Consent
              %p If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the features on neowin.net, but you will not be able to access areas that require registration. neowin.net may offer newsletters, which are sent only to opt-in lists. They also include a very easy and simple way to be removed once you have joined.
