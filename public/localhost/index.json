Missing that one important email because your inbox is cluttered with garbage. \r\n\r\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. \r\n\r\nSEE ALSO: The best thing you can do to protect yourself from hackers\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are numerous tricks you can use to make sure that you see the emails you want to see, when you want to see them.

The default flag is called an \"importance marker,\" and it's slapped on an email after Google's fancy algorithms have used a variety of factors to determine that it's worth giving a damn about. \r\n\r\nThose factors include, but are not limited to, practical considerations like \"who you email, and how often you email them,\" \"which emails you open,\" and \"which emails you reply to.\"\r\n\r\nIf Google does decide an email is worthy of an importance marker, you'll see what looks like a little rightward-facing arrow in your inbox pointing to the message in question. If you only want to see emails marked in this way, search \"is:important\" in your inbox search bar. \r\n\r\nBut what if this default option isn't a good fit? What if Gmail's importance markers miss your actually important stuff and only serve to confuse you? \r\n\r\nThat's totally cool, because there are more tools in the Gmail toolshed.\r\n\r\n Such a special email.","format":"Post","summary":null,"keywords":null,"color":null,"subcategory_id":7,"user_id":1,"via_url":null,"via_name":null,"source_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08T02:18:50.092Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T02:18:50.092Z","url":"http://localhost:3000/stop-missing-emails-you-actually-care-about-with-these-easy-tricks.json"},{"id":9,"title":"SitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator","image":"/assets/images/9/original/sunset.jpg?1494250483","content":"\u003cp\u003edfdasfdsaf\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","format":"Post","summary":null,"keywords":null,"color":null,"subcategory_id":7,"user_id":1,"via_url":null,"via_name":null,"source_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08T13:34:45.339Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T13:34:45.339Z","url":"http://localhost:3000/sitemapgenerator-is-a-framework-agnostic-xml-sitemap-generator.json"},{"id":10,"title":"SitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator","image":"/assets/images/10/original/Climb.jpg?1494250504","content":"\u003cp\u003eSitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","format":"Post","summary":null,"keywords":null,"color":null,"subcategory_id":8,"user_id":2,"via_url":null,"via_name":null,"source_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08T13:35:05.634Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T13:35:05.634Z","url":"http://localhost:3000/sitemapgenerator-is-a-framework-agnostic-xml-sitemap-generator-858d4784-5c31-4d04-9769-63127f35ce28.json"},{"id":11,"title":"SitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator","image":"/assets/images/11/original/direction.jpg?1494251216","content":"\u003cp\u003eSitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","format":"Post","summary":null,"keywords":null,"color":null,"subcategory_id":1,"user_id":2,"via_url":null,"via_name":null,"source_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08T13:46:57.792Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T13:46:57.792Z","url":"http://localhost:3000/sitemapgenerator-is-a-framework-agnostic-xml-sitemap-generator-74ffccf5-4805-4a7c-ac67-4d8ae1ae3dc0.json"},{"id":12,"title":"SitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator","image":"/assets/images/12/original/sunset.jpg?1494251233","content":"\u003cp\u003eSitemapGenerator is a framework-agnostic XML Sitemap generator\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","format":"Post","summary":null,"keywords":null,"color":null,"subcategory_id":2,"user_id":2,"via_url":null,"via_name":null,"source_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-08T13:47:14.949Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T13:47:14.949Z","url":"http://localhost:3000/sitemapgenerator-is-a-framework-agnostic-xml-sitemap-generator-973dac32-0bb9-46a6-9f12-d64b9f3da827.json"}]
